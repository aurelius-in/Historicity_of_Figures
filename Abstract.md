## Abstract

This research proposal aims to use advanced machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and deep learning models such as Transformers and GPT-3.5 to analyze the historicity of religious figures such as Jesus, Moses, Buddha, and Confucius. The methodology will involve analyzing non-religious historical texts and other relevant data, assigning a historicity score represented as a percentage to each figure, and ranking them in order of their likelihood of being historical. The expected results are a new perspective on the historical accuracy of these revered religious and cultural figures and a better understanding of their impact on our world. The study will also contribute to the field of machine learning by demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques in analyzing historical data. The study's importance lies in shedding light on the validity of religious teachings and beliefs and how they shape our worldview.
