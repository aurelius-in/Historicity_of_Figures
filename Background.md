Background:
The study of the historicity of religious figures has been a topic of debate for centuries. Belief in the existence of these figures is often based on faith and religious texts, with a lack of concrete evidence to support their historicity. This has led to debates among scholars and historians about the accuracy of these figures and their impact on our understanding of history and religion.

The use of advanced machine learning techniques such as NLP, Sentiment Analysis, and deep learning models such as Transformers and GPT-3.5 can provide a more objective analysis of the likelihood of these figures being historical. By collecting and analyzing non-religious historical texts, images, and other relevant data, we can gain new insights into the historicity of these revered religious and cultural figures.

The study of the historicity of religious figures has far-reaching implications for our understanding of history, religion, and culture. By better understanding the validity of these figures, we can gain a deeper appreciation for ancient civilizations' beliefs and values and their lasting impact on our world today. The use of advanced machine learning techniques in this study demonstrates the effectiveness of these techniques in analyzing historical data and provides a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning.
