## Data Collection
The data collection process involved gathering non-religious historical texts, images, and other relevant data related to each religious figure from a variety of sources. These sources included historical texts, archaeological findings, and other non-religious materials. The data collection process was comprehensive, with data from multiple sources being analyzed for each figure to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.

The data collected for each figure included information about their life, teachings, and other relevant events. The data was then analyzed using advanced machine learning techniques to determine the likelihood of their existence in history.
