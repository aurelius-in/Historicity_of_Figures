### Historicity Scores:

Many of the characters listed in the table have been the subject of various stories and myths throughout history, often containing elements that are fantastical or exaggerated. However, some of these characters are believed to be based on historical figures who actually lived, even though their stories and legends may not be entirely accurate.

When we examine the historical records and evidence available, we can see that some of these characters have a greater degree of historicity than others. For example, figures such as Abraham, Buddha, Confucius, King Arthur, King David, Lao Tzu, Moses, and Muhammad are widely believed to have been real individuals who lived in the past. However, the stories and myths that have been told about them over the years may not always reflect their true lives and experiences.

On the other hand, characters such as Adam and Eve, Gilgamesh, Jonah, Noah, and Robin Hood are primarily considered to be mythological figures. These characters are believed to have originated in tales and legends passed down through oral tradition, and their existence as historical figures is much more uncertain.

In general, the distinction between myth-based and person-based characters is not always clear-cut. Even for characters with a high degree of historicity, the stories and legends that surround them may contain elements of myth and exaggeration. Conversely, even for characters that are primarily considered to be mythological, there may be some kernel of truth or historical basis that gave rise to their stories.

In conclusion, the depiction of these characters as either person-based or myth-based is often a matter of degree rather than a strict binary. Each character's historicity is based on the available evidence, but the stories and myths that surround them often reflect the cultural values and beliefs of the people who told them.

The historicity scores in the table are based on the available historical evidence and the degree to which a character is believed to be based on an actual historical figure. However, the scores are not absolute and may be subject to interpretation and debate.

In the case of Jesus and Mary, their low historicity scores reflect the fact that the historical evidence for their existence is relatively limited and disputed. While there are some non-Christian sources that mention Jesus, such as the Jewish historian Josephus, the references to him are brief and do not provide a detailed account of his life. Additionally, the Gospels themselves were written several decades after Jesus' death and are believed to have been influenced by the beliefs and biases of the early Christian community.

As for Mary, there is little historical evidence about her life beyond what is mentioned in the New Testament. Some scholars have even questioned whether she was a real historical figure or simply a symbolic representation of the early Christian community's beliefs about the importance of motherhood and virginity.

Factors such as the reliability of historical sources, the cultural and political context in which they were written, and the biases and beliefs of the authors and their audiences can all influence the degree of historicity attributed to a particular character. In the case of characters like Adam and Eve or Robin Hood, for example, the lack of reliable historical evidence suggests that they are more likely to be mythological in nature.

Overall, the historicity scores reflect the available evidence and the degree of certainty that a particular character was based on an actual historical figure. However, they are not absolute and may be subject to revision as new evidence or interpretations come to light.
