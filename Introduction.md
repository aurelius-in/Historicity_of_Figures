Introduction:
The historicity of religious figures has been a topic of debate among scholars and historians for centuries. The belief in the existence of these figures is often based on faith and religious texts, with a lack of concrete evidence to support their historicity. This research study aimed to provide a more objective analysis of the likelihood of 20 religious and cultural figures being historical using advanced machine learning techniques.

The figures analyzed in this study included Abraham, Buddha, Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad, among others. The study used non-religious historical texts, images, and other relevant data to analyze each figure's historicity. Advanced machine learning techniques such as NLP, Sentiment Analysis, and deep learning models such as Transformers and GPT-3.5 were employed to generate historicity scores for each figure.

The study holds great significance as it sheds light on the historical accuracy of revered religious and cultural figures, ultimately impacting our perception and belief in their teachings. By determining the likelihood of their existence through the use of advanced machine learning techniques, we can better understand the validity of their teachings and the extent to which we can rely on them as factual sources. Such insights can lead to a better understanding of ancient civilizations' beliefs and values and their lasting impact on our world today.
