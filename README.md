Research Proposal: Analyzing the Historicity of Religious Figures

## Introduction

Historicity is the degree to which something or someone can be considered historically real and accurate. In the case of religious figures such as Jesus, Moses, Buddha, and Confucius, their historicity has been debated for centuries. This research study aims to provide a more objective analysis of the likelihood of these figures being historical using cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

## Background

Belief in the existence of religious figures is often based on faith and religious texts, with a lack of concrete evidence to support their historicity. This has led to debates among scholars and historians.

## List of Figures for Historical Analysis

- Abraham
- Adam and Eve
- Buddha
- Confucius
- Gilgamesh
- Jesus
- Job
- Jonah
- King Arthur
- King David
- Krishna
- Lao Tzu
- Moses
- Muhammad
- Noah
- Robin Hood
- Samson
- Shakespeare
- Virgin Mary
- Zoroaster

## Importance

This study holds great significance as it sheds light on the historical accuracy of revered religious and cultural figures, ultimately impacting our perception and belief in their teachings. By determining the likelihood of their existence through the use of advanced machine learning techniques, we can better understand the validity of their teachings and the extent to which we can rely on them as factual sources. Such insights can lead to a better understanding of ancient civilizations' beliefs and values and their lasting impact on our world today. Ultimately, this research can aid in shaping our worldview, impacting how we approach religion, history, and mythology, and the weight we give to teachings and beliefs attributed to these figures.

## Historicity Score

Each figure will be evaluated and assigned a historicity score represented as a percentage, indicating the likelihood of their actual existence in history. They will also be ranked according to this score, with figures having a historicity score of less than 50% being considered highly unlikely to have ever existed and likely to have been invented through oral tradition and mythological storytelling.

To determine the historicity scores, advanced machine learning techniques will be used such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Sentiment Analysis, and a more cutting-edge deep learning model such as a Transformer or a GPT-3.5 based model. These techniques will enable us to analyze large amounts of text data, identify patterns, and make predictions with greater accuracy.

## Methodology

The study will collect historical texts, images, and other relevant data related to each religious figure from a variety of non-religious sources. This data will be analyzed using advanced machine learning techniques.

NLP will be used to analyze and categorize the bias levels of historical texts about each figure, based on the language used and context. This can help give more weight to texts that have a lower religious bias, and less weight to texts that have a higher bias.

A more advanced deep learning model such as a Transformer or a GPT-3.5 based model can be used to analyze the correlation between historical events and the claims made about each religious figure. By training the model on a dataset that includes historical events and claims about each figure, we can determine which claims have a higher likelihood of being historically accurate based on the correlation with other events.

The scores generated by these advanced machine learning techniques will be used to rank each religious figure in order of likelihood of being historical.

## Expected Results
The expected results of this study are a set of scores ranking each religious figure in order of their likelihood of being historical, based on an analysis of non-religious historical texts, images, and other relevant data. Each figure will be assigned a rank and a historicity score represented as a percentage of historicity. 

Figures with a historicity score of less than 50% are highly unlikely to have ever existed and likely to have been invented through oral tradition and mythological storytelling.

The results of this study will provide a new perspective on the historical accuracy of these figures, and will allow us to better understand the impact they have had on our world. Additionally, this study will contribute to the field of machine learning by demonstrating the effectiveness of natural language processing, random forests, and convolutional neural networks in analyzing historical data.

## Conclusion:

The study aims to use advanced machine learning techniques such as NLP, sentiment analysis, and deep learning models such as Transformers and GPT-3.5 to analyze the historicity of religious figures like Jesus, Moses, Buddha, and Confucius. Through the use of non-religious historical texts and other relevant data, the study aims to provide a more objective analysis of the likelihood of these figures being historical.

The expected results are a set of scores ranking each figure in order of their likelihood of being historical, with figures having a historicity score of less than 50% being considered highly unlikely to have ever existed and likely to have been invented through oral tradition and mythological storytelling. The study will provide new insights into the historical accuracy of these revered religious and cultural figures, ultimately impacting our perception and belief in their teachings.

This study will also contribute to the field of machine learning by demonstrating the effectiveness of natural language processing, random forests, and convolutional neural networks in analyzing historical data. The references for historicity of the figures in ancient texts provide a solid foundation for this study, and the methodology employed will ensure that the results are accurate and reliable.
