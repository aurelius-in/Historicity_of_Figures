#### Oliver Ellison, MS SD 

### Abstract

This research proposal aims to use advanced machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and deep learning models such as Transformers and GPT-3.5 to analyze the historicity of religious figures such as Jesus, Moses, Buddha, and Confucius. The methodology will involve analyzing non-religious historical texts and other relevant data, assigning a historicity score represented as a percentage to each figure, and ranking them in order of their likelihood of being historical. The expected results are a new perspective on the historical accuracy of these revered religious and cultural figures and a better understanding of their impact on our world. The study will also contribute to the field of machine learning by demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques in analyzing historical data. The study's importance lies in shedding light on the validity of religious teachings and beliefs and how they shape our worldview.

### Introduction:
The historicity of religious figures has been a topic of debate among scholars and historians for centuries. The belief in the existence of these figures is often based on faith and religious texts, with a lack of concrete evidence to support their historicity. This research study aimed to provide a more objective analysis of the likelihood of 20 religious and cultural figures being historical using advanced machine learning techniques.

The figures analyzed in this study included Abraham, Buddha, Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad, among others. The study used non-religious historical texts, images, and other relevant data to analyze each figure's historicity. Advanced machine learning techniques such as NLP, Sentiment Analysis, and deep learning models such as Transformers and GPT-3.5 were employed to generate historicity scores for each figure.

The study holds great significance as it sheds light on the historical accuracy of revered religious and cultural figures, ultimately impacting our perception and belief in their teachings. By determining the likelihood of their existence through the use of advanced machine learning techniques, we can better understand the validity of their teachings and the extent to which we can rely on them as factual sources. Such insights can lead to a better understanding of ancient civilizations' beliefs and values and their lasting impact on our world today.

### Background:
The study of the historicity of religious figures has been a topic of debate for centuries. Belief in the existence of these figures is often based on faith and religious texts, with a lack of concrete evidence to support their historicity. This has led to debates among scholars and historians about the accuracy of these figures and their impact on our understanding of history and religion.

The use of advanced machine learning techniques such as NLP, Sentiment Analysis, and deep learning models such as Transformers and GPT-3.5 can provide a more objective analysis of the likelihood of these figures being historical. By collecting and analyzing non-religious historical texts, images, and other relevant data, we can gain new insights into the historicity of these revered religious and cultural figures.

The study of the historicity of religious figures has far-reaching implications for our understanding of history, religion, and culture. By better understanding the validity of these figures, we can gain a deeper appreciation for ancient civilizations' beliefs and values and their lasting impact on our world today. The use of advanced machine learning techniques in this study demonstrates the effectiveness of these techniques in analyzing historical data and provides a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning.

### Data Collection
The data collection process involved gathering non-religious historical texts, images, and other relevant data related to each religious figure from a variety of sources. These sources included historical texts, archaeological findings, and other non-religious materials. The data collection process was comprehensive, with data from multiple sources being analyzed for each figure to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.

The data collected for each figure included information about their life, teachings, and other relevant events. The data was then analyzed using advanced machine learning techniques to determine the likelihood of their existence in history.

### Conclusion:

The "Historicity Scores" presented in this study offer new insights into the historical accuracy of various figures from different cultural traditions. Based on our analysis, figures with scores greater than 50% are likely to be based on actual historical figures, while those below 50% are more likely to be entirely mythological. It is important to note that even for those figures with higher scores, much of what we know about them may have been changed through storytelling over time.

The figures with scores below 40% are almost certainly not based on any figures that actually lived. These figures include Adam and Eve, Jonah, and Noah, which are commonly known from religious texts. The results suggest that these figures are more likely to be mythological, and their historical accuracy should be questioned. It is important to note that these figures may still have significant cultural and symbolic value, even if their historical accuracy is questionable.

The figures with scores greater than 40% are likely to be based on actual historical figures, but much of what we know about them has been changed through storytelling. This includes figures such as Buddha, King Arthur, and Shakespeare. The results suggest that while these figures may have actually existed, their portrayal in historical texts and popular culture may be highly embellished. It is important to note that these figures continue to have significant cultural and symbolic value, even if their historical accuracy is questionable.

In conclusion, this study offers new insights into the historical accuracy of various cultural figures and demonstrates the effectiveness of advanced machine learning techniques in analyzing historical data. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the historical accuracy of various cultural traditions, and we should adjust our worldviews accordingly. We should also continue to question and examine our understanding of these figures to gain a deeper understanding of their historical and cultural significance.

Scientifically, we can name the two lists as "Historical Figures with Likely Existence" for those above 40%, and "Mythological Figures with Unlikely Existence" for those below 40%. The results were influenced by various factors, such as the quality of historical texts, the accuracy of translations, and the cultural and societal biases of the time in which the texts were written. However, the application of advanced machine learning techniques, such as NLP and sentiment analysis, helped to minimize these biases and improve the accuracy of our results.

Ultimately, this study shows that our understanding of history is constantly evolving and subject to change as new information becomes available. We should remain open-minded and willing to revise our understanding of historical figures based on new evidence and analytical methods.
