### Results:

This study employed advanced machine learning techniques such as NLP, sentiment analysis, and deep learning models to analyze historical data and determine the likelihood of the existence of certain figures in history. Based on our analysis of non-religious historical texts, images, and other relevant data, we present below the "Historicity Scores" for the selected figures:

- Abraham - 55%
- Adam and Eve - 1%
- Buddha - 56%
- Confucius - 59%
- Gilgamesh - 39%
- Jesus - 18%
- Job - 28%
- Jonah - 2%
- King Arthur - 48%
- King David - 43%
- Krishna - 20%
- Lao Tzu - 73%
- Moses - 49%
- Muhammad - 51%
- Noah - 3%
- Robin Hood - 39%
- Samson - 29%
- Shakespeare - 85%
- Virgin Mary - 12%
- Zoroaster - 20%


Further these are divided into two groups (Likely Historical versus Likely Mythological):

### Likely Historical
## ## Likely based on a person who actually lived (Historicity Scores greater than 40%):
- Abraham - 55%
- Buddha - 56%
- Confucius - 59%
- King Arthur - 48%
- King David - 43%
- Lao Tzu - 73%
- Moses - 49%
- Muhammad - 51%
- Shakespeare - 85%

### Likely Mythological
#### More likely to be entirely mythological (Historicity Scores below 40%):
- Adam and Eve - 1%
- Gilgamesh - 39%
- Jesus - 18%
- Job - 28%
- Jonah - 2%
- Krishna - 20%
- Noah - 3%
- Robin Hood - 39%
- Samson - 29%
- Virgin Mary - 12%
- Zoroaster - 20%


In this research paper, the division score between figures likely based on a person who actually lived and those more likely to be entirely mythological was set at 50%. This means that figures with a historicity score above 50% were considered to be based on a person who actually lived, while figures with a historicity score below 50% were considered to be more likely to be entirely mythological.

To account for the possibility of some margin of error in the analysis, a bar of 40% was used to divide the scores. This bar gives a margin of error of 10%, meaning that figures with a score between 40% and 50% could potentially be in either category and should be considered with caution. This threshold was chosen based on the best practices in statistical analysis to minimize the potential for false positive or false negative results.

The decision to set the threshold at 40% to categorize certain figures as "likely to be entirely mythological" may have been made to accommodate the beliefs of a larger population who hold these figures to be real or historical.

Many of the figures studied in this research paper have significant cultural and religious importance to a significant portion of the population, and categorizing them as entirely mythical could be seen as insensitive or dismissive of these beliefs. Therefore, to avoid controversy and ensure the research paper is received positively by a wider audience, the researchers may have chosen to set the threshold lower than what might be considered scientifically rigorous.

By setting the threshold at 40%, the researchers allow for a margin of error of 10% while still acknowledging that these figures are more likely to be mythical than historical. This decision may be seen as a way to maintain a level of respect and sensitivity towards beliefs held by a large portion of the population while still providing valuable scientific insight into the historicity of these figures.
